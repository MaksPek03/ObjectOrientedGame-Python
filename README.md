The main goal of the project is the implementation of a 2D virtual world simulator. The virtual world have the structure of a two-dimensional NxM grid. In this world, simple life forms will exist, each with different behavior depending on its species.

All action in the simulator are performed in turns. During each turn, every living organism in the world perform an action appropriate to their kind. Some of them will move (animals), while others will remain static (plants). In case of a collision (one of the organisms enters a cell occupied by another organism) one of them wins, either by killing its opponent (i.e. wolf) or by reflecting the opponent's attack (i.e. turtle). The order of all actions during a single turn depends on the initiative of each living organism. The animals with the highest initiative move first. In case of animals with the same initiative, the order is determined by the animal's age (the oldest animal will move first). In case of a collision, the victory depends on the strength of both organisms - the stronger organism wins
