🕹️ Object-Oriented 2D Virtual World Simulator 🌍

This project is part of a University course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves creating a 2D virtual world simulator, where various life forms (e.g., animals and plants) interact within an NxM grid. The simulation follows turn-based actions based on each organism's behavior, initiative, and strength.

🚀 Features:

Turn-Based Actions: Organisms perform actions like moving, attacking, or staying static.

Species Behavior: Different behaviors depending on the organism (e.g., animals moving, plants staying still).

Collision System: When organisms collide, the stronger one wins, or one reflects the attack.

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/MaksPek03/ObjectOrientedGame-Python.git
